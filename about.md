Hello everyone! My name is Marlon Marques and I'm a senior in Computer Science
at [UFMG](http://dcc.ufmg.br/dcc/). I am passionate about building any kind of
software, but my current professional focus in on the EDA industry. My other
areas of interest are Computer Security, Robotics and Rock & Roll music. \m/

I have experience with several programming languages, but my language of choice
is undoubtedly C++, specially C++11 and C++14! Modern C++ Programming rocks,
right?!

### More Information

During my years in college there were several experiences that forever shaped my
life. One of those were my exchange year at the [University of Southern California](http://usc.edu/),
in which I obtained a specialization in Digital Forensics. Fight On!

In the past I've had the chance of working with a handful of web development
projects, which were very fun. The technologies I've used include: Ruby on Rails,
MEAN Stack, PHP, among others. If you want to know more about my professional
experiences, feel free to check my [LinkedIn profile](https://br.linkedin.com/in/marlon-marques-3861a183).
